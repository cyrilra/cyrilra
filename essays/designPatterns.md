## Designing Patterns?

The idea of designing patterns is plain as simple: DESIGN a PATTERN. That is all there is to it, but what about when it comes to other things that aren't really that physical or on appearance. One strong example is coding. Design patterns in coding start to become much deeper than what the general idea or concept of design patterns are. A bunch of words correlate to this coding thingymabob and honestly, to me, that's too much. The image on the right and below show on deep design patterns in coding go. It's like those iceberg memes that focus on certain topics, i.e.: the internet iceberg, etc. However, I do know how incredibly important these designs patterns are in coding. They are templates for the actual code. It's sort of like problem-solving pseudocode and one way to compare this would to be like a construction working looking at an architect's blueprints. However these blueprints aren't necessarily finished, but rather how we approach a problem and solving it through code. It's interesting the types of approaches coders choose depending on the issue they're presented. Fascinating, right?

## Blueprints

Because I'm just a low class construction worker, reading these blueprints are quite confusing. In reality, I would just follow whoever my superior is and follow their orders since they clearly understand what needs to be done. However, 

## So is it the Former or the Latter?
I guess it would be both really, but it is however you look at it. Design patterns in coding are cool and kind of interesting the many types of design patterns there are. There are specific patterns for certain programming languages which is super fascinating and really shows how depth and complex design patterns are/can be.
