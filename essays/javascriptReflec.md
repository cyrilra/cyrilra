## My First Hike

JavaScript is certainly one of those languages I do enjoy using, but it wasn't always like that. I first began learning JavaScript back in 2019, as a sophomoore in high school and I must say, it was way more daunting and confusing when looking back. Learning a new coding language, or coding in general is definitely an experience. From understanding the syntax to just formatting, it gets confusing fast. JavaScript was a mountain I had a trouble climbing, but now there's a new path I got to explore. 
## Current Hike
Revisiting JavaScript and having to do both the JavaScript and ES6 modules, I definitely learned a lot more than I have back in high school. Destructuring, arrow functions, rest parameters, etc - these modules were something else. I had no idea of these concepts/tools that JavaScript had and it just feels like I learn new thing everytime I go back to coding in this language. Comparing this language to many others such as C++ or Python, it definitely has its own special properties. It has its unique syntax and does require more typing than others, although I am not complaining. From a software engineering perspective, it is an incredibly useful programming language. Despite its rather more popular competitors due to their more easy-to-use/understandable syntax, JavaScript makes coding web pages a lot more easier. Although that is coming from a student who has only coded web pages using the following: HTML, CSS, and Java/JavaScript. I have yet to implement Python or C++ into webpages, but through minor research, it seems that JavaScript is still much easier to implement. To describe JavaScript in a few words is how I can describe many other languages, expect to learn something new everytime. It's like finding a new hike trail upon a trail you've already hiked.

## A Rockslide
I find atheletic software engineering to be quite intriguing and interesting. It is quite useful and it does, in a way, replicate a real-world situation within big tech companies. To put students in a all or nothing graded activity under quite strict time constraints is something I have never really experienced yet. It really opens my eyes to know that everyday software engineers/computer programmers have to deal with these WODS. It's really useful for us students and I believe will definitely make all of us better even if it is just a 0.1% better. Despite the usefulness, it is stressful due to such strict time constraints. Although, I still find it to be enjoyable because of how it sort of replicates a real-world scenario. Personally, I am very bad with doing work under time, but I believe I will adapt and it can eventually work for me. I hope...
