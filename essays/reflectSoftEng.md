### Into the Dark
  Throughout this ICS 314 course, I've started to slowly grasp and learn the fundamental software engineering concepts. My first impression of this course was actually that this course will just be strictly learning web application development and how to make different types of websites. However, despite how true that was, I sort of picked up on the concepts behind each module. It's like finding a new path in a cave you've thought you've already fully explored. It's fascinating how interesting and how deep each concept can go. A few of the concepts I found quite interesting were open source software developments, development environments, and user interface frameworks. Those concepts were really fascinating to me and were the ones that I really enjoyed learning about.  

### A Bug: Open Source Software Development
  Open source software development is one of those concepts that is really cool to me. Open source software development, for those who do not know, is software that is published or distributed with its source code, the actual thing that makes the software work, and anyone can use the source code however they like as long as the rights are properly credited. The concept for this is really cool and how openly cooperative programmers that publish this type of work are. Big examples of open source softwares are Firebox and Linux. Those two softwares are completely open source and people can freely use its source code however they want. I've always wanted to understand
