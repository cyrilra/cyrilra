I first started judo around my sophomore year of high school and have fallen in love with the martial art. After my graduation, I became a coach for the team and whenever I have the time, I comeby and help. I am still a blue-belt and I am striving for a higher belt. I strive to be better so if I am ready for a belt promotion, I can feel as if I have properly earned it.
