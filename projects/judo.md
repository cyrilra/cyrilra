summary: "I am part of the judo team for Waipahu High School"
---
I first started judo around my sophomore year of high school and have fallen in love with the martial art. After my graduation, I became a coach for the team and whenever I have the time, I come by and help. I am still a blue-belt and I am striving for a higher belt. I constantly try to improve so when I am ready for a belt promotion, I can proudly say that I have fairly earned it. 

2023 was definitely a rough year, but hopefully 2024 I can continue to pursue it more!

This was in my senior year and I was allowed to play for my team after a knee injury:
