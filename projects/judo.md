summary: "I am part of the judo team for Waipahu High School"
---
I first started judo around my sophomore year of high school and have fallen in love with the martial art. After my graduation, I became a coach for the team and whenever I have the time, I comeby and help. I am still a blue-belt and I am striving for a higher belt. I strive to be better so if I am ready for a belt promotion, I can feel as if I have properly earned it. Judo is something I gladly took the first step into. 
This was in my senior year and I was allowed to play for my team after a knee injury:
