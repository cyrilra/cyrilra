Back in 2020 when COVID-19 just hit, my computer science class for high school had to participate in the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. We made a group of four at random and were tasked to think of an idea, pitch said idea, and then create the idea. Afterwards, we would have to present to a selection of judges for the challenge. From the beginning all the way to the end, the process took over a month or so. It was definitely an experience as a sophomore in high school. It was both exciting and stressful although it was a major learning experience for almost everyone in my class.
